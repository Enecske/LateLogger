# LateLogger
**A student latency logger system for schools, written in Python**

## Features
#### Find students using webcam
Using [Adam Geitgey](https://github.com/ageitgey)'s [face_recognition](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition) library,
LateLogger can extract people from a webcamera

#### Log the lateness of students
LateLogger detects the current class, and starts itself with the current configuration of students for accurate lateness detection.
After a class has ended, LateLogger logs the students' lateness.

#### Easily manage classes and students
LateLogger offers command-line tools for managing the class schedule, classes and students.

The following commands are avaiable:
- `python setup`: Set up the config file
- `python class_schedule <view|edit>`: Manage class schedule
- `python create_class <classname>`: Create a new class
- `python edit_class <classname>`: Edit an existing class
